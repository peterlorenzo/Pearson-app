# Pearson-app
A test project using basic React, Redux, and d3

This is a test app I created using create-react-app. It allows a user to upload one or more .csv files, then view a header of each csv (similar to R's head() function). The user can choose a csv and two columns and see an 'analysis' page that shows the user the Pearson correlation coefficient, a linear regression, and a scatterplot of the chosen data.

This app uses React and Redux to manage the user interface and data storage. It also uses the papa-parse package to read the csv files and some basic functions from the d3 data visualization library to display the scatterplot on the 'analysis' page.
