This is a test project that I made to learn basic React & Redux. It also uses papa-parse (to read csv files) and some basic functions from the d3 data visualization library.

This application lets users upload one or more csv files ('Upload' tab); view some basic info (similar to R's head() function) and select two columns from one file to compare in the 'Datasets' tab, and then view the Pearson correlation coefficient of those columns, a scatterplot of the data and a linear regression trendline in the 'Analysis' tab. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.
